### Design 

1. **Logo** 
The logo was created using [Free Logo Maker](https://logomakr.com). It was designed to to show the love for coffee that can be shared by two people. The coffee beans are used in place of a heart and colored red to symbolise this. This logo can be seen at the top of this page. 

2. **Colour Scheme**

The colours for the website were chosen using [Coolors](https://coolors.co/fdecfb-a97160-dfbe99). They were chosen with the aim to represent coffee and the love that goes into it. The chosen colours are:

* ![#DFBE99](https://placehold.it/15/DFBE99/000000?text=+) '#DFBE99' - Tan

3. **Fonts**

The website has the main font of Roboto Slab, which was chosen due to it **readability to all users**. Furthermore, it modern which will fit with the aim of the website.
