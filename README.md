## Introduction

Welcome to Hoffi Coffi, thats '**Love Coffee**' in the **Welsh language**. The app is designed to bring coffee drinkers like myself, together to choose their favourite coffees from a list of products.

### Design 

1. **Logo** 
The logo was created using [Free Logo Maker](https://logomakr.com). It was designed to to show the love for coffee that can be shared by two people. The coffee beans are used in place of a heart and colored red to symbolise this. This logo can be seen at the top of this page.
